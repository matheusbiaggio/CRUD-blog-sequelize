## ðŸ“’ Introduction

This is a project in which an API was implemented following the MSC architecture (Model - Service - Controller) with the help of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, the Sequelize. 

The main idea was to implement an API for the possible implementation of a generic blog. This application was built in Node.js using the Sequelize package to perform CRUD operations on posts and users. Endpoints were developed, which are connected to a database following REST principles. In addition, it is required that the user is logged in, i.e., has made a login to generate a token, allowing them to perform post insertion, update, retrieval, and deletion.

## :book: Database

The database consists of three tables, namely "categories", "posts_categories", "blog_posts" and "users". The "posts_categories" table refers to the categories of each post.

## :bulb: Installation

To start the project, it is necessary to install npm in the directory and start the Docker. Docker-compose needs to be version 1.29 or higher.

install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

docker-compose up -d
```
